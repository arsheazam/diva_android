Diva Android Pen Testing


Introduction

DIVA

DIVA (Damn insecure and vulnerable App) is an App intentionally designed to be insecure. It is Android version of Diva. It would be a nice way to start the year by contributing something to the security community. The aim of the App is to teach developers/QA/security professionals, flaws that are generally present in the Apps due poor or insecure coding practices. If anyone reading this, you want to either learn App pen testing or secure coding and I sincerely hope that DIVA solves your purpose.
